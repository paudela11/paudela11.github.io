I am a graduate research assistant in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at the Michigan State University, where I am advised by [Prof. Peng Zhang](https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/pz). I am part of the research group [NanoPATH](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~pz/) which specializes in theoretical and computational research in nanoelectronics, electromagnetic fields and waves, plasmas, and accelerator technology. 


General Interest
======

I am broadly interested in the field of semiconductor physics, VLSI, microcontroller technologies as well as my passion of music.
