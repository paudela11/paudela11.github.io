<div style="border: 4px solid LightSkyBlue; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;">

I am a graduate research assistant in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at the Michigan State University, where I am advised by [Prof. Peng Zhang](https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/pz). I am part of the research group [NanoPATH](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~pz/).

 I will be graduating in May 2023 with a Masters in ECE. I am seeking opportunities to kickstart my career as a electronics engineer in the semiconductor industry.
