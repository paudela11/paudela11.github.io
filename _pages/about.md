I am a graduate research assistant in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at the Michigan State University, where I am advised by [Prof. Peng Zhang](https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/pz). I am part of the research group [NanoPATH](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~pz/). I will be graduating in May 2023 with a Masters in ECE. I am seeking opportunities to kickstart my career as a electronics engineer in the semiconductor industry.

I love music. Checkout my latest performance here (I am the one playing the lead guitar):

I also love hiking and being out in the nature. Being from Nepal, I am naturally attracted to the most strenuos of them. Here's a picture of me in the grand canyon.

I also like adventure sports. Rafting, scuba, mountaneering, etc are all fun. But the most exhillerating thrill that I have ever experienced was bungee jumping.
